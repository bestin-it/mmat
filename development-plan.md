# MMAT Development Plan and Status

## Analysis of Developed vs. Planned Features

Based on the `README.md` and `matt-functional-description.md` files, here is an analysis of the developed and planned components of the MMAT framework:

**Currently Developed/Implemented:**

*   Core Python framework structure, including modules for CLI, configuration, core logic, utilities, and basic tests.
*   Installation process via pip and setting up the `mmat` alias on Windows.
*   Project initialization using the `mmat init` command.
*   Concepts and file structures for Functional Descriptions (Markdown), Functional Test Plans (YAML/JSON), and E2E Tests (Playwright Python).
*   Configuration management via `config.yaml` for environments, models, and reporting. **LLM models configured in main config.yaml.** Specifically, `mistralai/mistral-small-3.2` is used for the visual LLM model and `mistralai/magistral-small` for thinking with tools. These models are run locally using LM Studio at `http://172.29.32.1:1234`.
*   Basic Playwright integration for browser automation and DOM reading.
*   HTML structure analysis capabilities.
*   A JSON reporter for test results.
*   The command-line interface (CLI) with commands like `run`, `generate`, `export`, `import-e2e`, `describe`, `feedback`, `list`, and `show` appears to be structured, although the full functionality of some commands relies on planned features. (Note: `build` command was corrected to `generate`).
*   **Integrated local API reasoning model for test plan generation (`mmat generate`).**

**Planned/Undeveloped Features:**

*   Advanced model-based capabilities, including:
    *   Full test plan generation from descriptions using AI models (`mmat build`). - **DONE** (Implemented using `mmat generate` with reasoning model)
    *   Visual analysis of screenshots via multimodal models.
    *   Building and updating a local knowledge graph of elements and interactions.
    *   Autonomous exploration and knowledge gathering during test execution.
    *   Post-test knowledge analysis and reasoning.
    *   Generating comprehensive test summaries and reports (beyond basic JSON).
    *   The full feedback cycle functionality (`mmat feedback`) for test improvement based on execution results and user input, especially for visual steps.
    *   Automatic synchronization between descriptions and tests after changes.
    *   Visual element identification using bounding boxes, OCR, and textual descriptions when DOM information is unavailable.
*   A separation layer for easily swapping the graph backend.
*   Full implementation of features like starting a test run from any specific step (`mmat run --step`).
*   Complete filtering and status reporting capabilities for the `mmat list` command.
*   Test Data Management.
*   Advanced Validation and Analysis features.
*   A comprehensive Plugin System for extending framework components.
*   Contributing guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`).
*   Web and Notebook interfaces (mentioned as non-functional requirements).

## Plan for Testing MMAT Commands in `test-mmat` Project

To test the MMAT commands, we can create a new project directory `test-mmat` and systematically use each command. This plan assumes we will need a simple web page or application to test against for commands like `run`.

1.  **Create the project directory:** Create a new directory named `test-mmat`. - **DONE**
2.  **Initialize MMAT project:** Navigate into `test-mmat` and run `mmat init .` (or `mmat init test-mmat` if we want a nested directory, but `.` is simpler for testing commands within the new root). This will set up the basic MMAT project structure (`functional_descriptions`, `tests`, `config`). - **DONE** (Corrected to `mmat init test-mmat` from parent directory)
3.  **Create a sample functional description:** Create a simple Markdown file (e.g., `test-mmat/functional_descriptions/sample_login.md`) describing a basic web interaction, like logging into a hypothetical page. - **DONE**
4.  **Test `mmat build`:** Use `mmat build` to generate a test plan (e.g., YAML) from the sample functional description. This will test the framework's ability to process descriptions and potentially use a reasoning model (if configured and available) to create a structured plan.
    *   Command: `mmat build functional_descriptions/sample_login.md --input-type markdown --output tests/functional/sample_login_plan.yaml --config config/config.yaml` (We'll need a basic `config.yaml` in `test-mmat/config` first, perhaps copied from the main MMAT project or created with minimal settings). - **DONE** (Corrected command to `mmat generate` and ensured `test-mmat/config/config.yaml` exists and is configured)
5.  **Test `mmat run`:** Attempt to run the generated test plan. This command requires a target web page and a configured environment (like Playwright). We would need to either point it to a live simple site or set up a local one for this test. This step will test the execution engine and environment interaction.
    *   Command: `mmat run tests/functional/sample_login_plan.yaml --plan-type yaml --config config/config.yaml` (Requires a running web target and configured `baseUrl` in `config.yaml`). - **DONE** (Tested against local `index.html`)
6.  **Test `mmat export`:** Export the generated test plan into Playwright Python code. This tests the conversion capability.
    *   Command: `mmat export tests/functional/sample_login_plan.yaml --output tests/e2e/sample_login_test.py` - **DONE**
7.  **Test `mmat import-e2e`:** Import the exported Playwright code back into an MMAT test plan format. This tests the reverse conversion.
    *   Command: `mmat import-e2e tests/e2e/sample_login_test.py --output tests/functional/imported_sample_login_plan.yaml` - **DONE**
8.  **Test `mmat describe`:** Generate a human-readable description from one of the test plans (either the original generated one or the imported one). This tests the description generation capability, likely involving a reasoning model.
    *   Command: `mmat describe tests/functional/sample_login_plan.yaml --output functional_descriptions/generated_description.md` - **DONE**
9.  **Test `mmat list`:** Use `mmat list` with various flags to see how it lists the created test files (`sample_login_plan.yaml`, `sample_login_test.py`, `imported_sample_login_plan.yaml`).
    *   Commands: `mmat list --all`, `mmat list --with-json`, `mmat list --with-playwright` - **DONE**
10. **Test `mmat show`:** Display the details of one of the test plan files.
    *   Command: `mmat show --test tests/functional/sample_login_plan.yaml` - **DONE**
11. **Testing `mmat feedback`:** This command is designed for interactive test improvement after a run failure. To test this, we would need to intentionally create or modify a test plan step so it fails during `mmat run`, and then use `mmat feedback` to see if the interactive process starts and allows for modifications. This might be more complex to automate and might require manual steps or a specifically crafted failing test case.
